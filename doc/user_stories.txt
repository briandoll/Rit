===========================

As a content creator, I want to
- log in to create and edit content

story tests
happy path:
* user is able to log in with their email address and password

story tests
happy path:
* user is able to create a new edition of a plate

sad path:
* cannot save without familiar name

- edit an existing plate edition
Content creators can edit the content, familiar name, description, status, start date, end date of a plate

happy path:
* user is able to edit edition

sad path
* cannot save if name is blank

- set a fallback edition for a plate
Content creators can set a fallback edition for a plate to be used when there are no scheduled editions.  The fallback setting only comes into play if no active edition can be found.  If the fallback edition has a schedule, the schedule will be considered first.

A fallback edition must be published.  A fallback edition cannot be added to any event.

The first edition of a plate is automatically fallback.  However, this edition is still not publishable.

happy path:
* user is able to set the fallback edition, overriding any previously set fallback

sad path:
* fallback edition cannot be set because the edition is not published

notes:
Upon creation of a new edition, it will, naturally, not be publishable.  It is up to the layout on the integrating app to handle this gracefully.

sad path:

- schedule a plate edition to activate and deactivate by hour
Content creators can schedule plate editions to activate.  They can also schedule deactivation, but it is not required.

happy path:
* user can schedule an edition to activate, if marked as active, edition activates on that day
* user can schedule an edition to deactivate, if marked as active, edition deactivates on that day

sad path:
* cannot save if end_date is before start_date

editions don't require end_dates

- schedule an event to activate and deactivate by hour
Content creators can schedule plate editions to activate and deactivate.  Event scheduling overrides any edition scheduling.

When two overlapping events that contain different editions for the same plate, go by start date.  Plate editions override events.  If there are matches by same type of start date, go with last updated at.

happy path:
* user can schedule an event to activate, if all editions marked as active, all editions belonging to that event activate on that day
* user can schedule an event to deactivate, if all editions marked as active, all editions belonging to that event deactivate on that day

Fo realz?

- be alerted if the event I'm attaching an edition to is currently live
Content creators should be aware that the changes they are making MAY be go live immediately.  It is difficult to know definitively without knowing which event they are attaching to.  Or is it?

happy path:
* users can see a pop up or banner with a warning

notes:
When we load the event list, we can know whether this plate edition will go live or not.  I think we can alert the user whether the plate they are attaching will be live immediately.

Fo realz?

- preview the entire site by date
Content creators can browse the app for any given date in the future, taking into account all scheduling.

happy path:
* user can see the app on a given date in the future in a frame while in rit.'s screens

sad path:
* site does not show because app is not properly integrated with rit. to receive date settings
* cannot preview site for a date in the past

- search plate edition content
Content creators can search the contents of all plate editions for a string

happy path:
* user can see a list of plate editions with content matching the search string

sad path:
* cannot search with blank string
* string cannot be found in any of the content

- upload media so that it is available on the live site
Content creators can upload media (images, sounds, movies) through a Media Browser so that it's available on the live site.  In our case, this will be uploaded to the CDN (through the assets server).  Content creators may then reference the media by URL in their editions.

happy path:
* user can upload the media and the media is available on the live site

sad path:
* cannot upload if the media format is unsupported
* cannot upload if the media is too large
* cannot upload if the filename already exists

(reject) preview all pages affected by an event
Content creators should be able to preview all pages affected by an event.  If there is an conflicting edition or event that occurs over the lifetime of the event, the user will be notified.  The preview of the page will show the actual state of the site on any given day, including conflicts.  This is actually duplicate functionality as preview site by date

happy path:
* Users can see a list of pages involved in the event.

reasons for rejection:
The API does not designate a way for the app to call for a specific plate edition.  The app may only call out for a plate name and the date, which returns the edition that will show on that date, according to all schedules and events.

(reject) preview a page by date
Content creators can preview the page that is associated with the plate they are currently working on.

reasons for rejection:
rit. does not have know what route a plate may belong to.  Also, with the one to many relationship of plates to layouts, which would we show.  This is being removed to keep rit. more focused.
